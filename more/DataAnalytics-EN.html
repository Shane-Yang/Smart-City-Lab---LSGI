                        <h2 >Urban Spatiotemporal Big Data Analytics</h2>
                        <p>Spatiotemporal big data analytics is the emerging technology to employ various spatial big data (e.g. location-based social network data, GPS-associated document, cellphone data, WIFI data, etc.) for geographical modelling, analysis and mining. Our team devotes to improving reliability of the analytics and applying the knowledge to real-world scenarios. </p>
                        <h3>Pattern mining and knowledge discovery from spatiotemporal data</h3>
                        <p>Pattern mining is to extract patterns from data that reveal implicit regularities, abnormalities and other interactions in the data. The resultant patterns ultimately lead to knowledges for understanding research subjects and making practical decisions. We innovate spatiotemporal data pattern mining methods with improved reliability of the data mining procedures and resultant knowledge. The new methods can recover lost data patterns and rectify interestingness measures of the patterns in presence of data noises and vague or gradual linguistic information, as well as filter out spurious patterns. The algorithms we have focused on include spatiotemporal association rule mining and sequential pattern mining from human movement trajectories. Our new methods have been applied to investigating the interactions between land use and socioeconomic changes, evaluating business site locations, and discovering user preferences of visiting POIs.

                        <h3>Geographical topic discovery</h3>
                        <p>Geographical topic discovery is to discover topics of spatial big data (e.g., GPS-associated document, geo-tagged social media data) in geographical context. Traditional statistical methods show limited effectiveness to handle social media data due to the predominance of short and noisy texts. We developed an unsupervised data-driven method to investigate the geographic pattern of social media topics, which can achieve a more accurate topic identification.

                        <h3>Crowd flow analysis</h3>
                        <p>Crowd flow analysis is a series of modelling, analysis and mining of human footprint. As the first base approach of understanding social space phenomenon, it plays an important role in aspects of economy, transportation, urban planning, etc. Traditional spatial data (e.g. census data, night light data) show limitations in Spatiotemporal granularity and object classification. We employ spatial big data like GPS-associated document, WIFI data and geo-tagged social media data for a more-refined crowd flow analysis both outdoor and indoor.</p>

                        <h3>Location Recommendation</h3>
                        <p>The increasing availabilities of location-based social networks (LBSNs) provide researchers with new tools and data sources to detect and recommend attractive locations, which facilitates usersâ€™ travels and social interactions. However, it remains a challenge that how to develop an effective model to to select and recommend candidate regions accordingly. We proposed a new region ranking and recommending strategy so that regions with high desirability can be more accurately predicted.</p>

                        <h3>Commercial site selection</h3>
                        <p>Commercial site selection is a hot topic in the field of economic geography by analyzing demographics, human flow in research area for spotting the optimal store location. Tradition methods with census data and investigation show limitations in labor consumption and update rate. We employ spatial big data like geo-tagged social media data in place popularity and human mobility analysis to replace some static factors in traditional site selection model. </p>
