                        <p>Our research aim is to develop a lightweight seamless 3D spatial data acquisition system as well as a 3D spatial data post-processing software toolkit.</p>
                        <h3>Lightweight seamless 3D spatial data acquisition system</h3>
                        <p>
                            <b>Multi-sensor:</b>the system synergizes 3D LiDAR, light field camera and 3D compass to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data capture. Multi-source point clouds with flexible and higher resolution, high precision (centimeter-level), and high reliability can be captured via the platform. The multi-source point clouds contain detailed objects and textures for indoor environment identification and modelling.<br/>
                            <b>Lightweight:</b>the system employs exclusive multiple-sensor integration to replace the traditional inertial measurement unit (IMU). The backpack platform has reduced weight due to the new material used for fabrication.<br/>
                            <b>Seamless:</b>the data acquisition can switch seamlessly between various indoor and outdoor environments, with no need for reconfiguration.<br/>
                            <b>Reliable:</b>the system utilizes advanced simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology. Highly suitable for densified urban environments like Hong Kong and indoor environments, the technology can be used to acquire high-precision 3D models with reduced number of ground control points.<br/>
                            <b>Rapid data collection:</b>a new data acquisition platform is needed to fill the gap between the relatively slow traditional laser scanning system and increasing demand for rapid geospatial data collection in indoor, outdoor, underground and even hazardous environments. The lightweight seamless 3D spatial data acquisition system is a good answer to the call for fast and flexible data acquisition.<br/>
                            <b>Complete documentation:</b>complete documentation of environment can be collected by this data acquisition system. This platform contains laser scanner, digital video camera, on-board processing devices, internal communication cables and power supply, which can collect range data and image data from surrounding. It synchronizes imagery and point cloud data, therefore assuring a complete documentation of environment.<br/>

                        <h3>3D spatial data post-processing software toolkit</h3>
                        <p>
                            <b>Accurate positioning and model building:</b>the software realizes progressive professional indoor 3D model construction. The used of SLAM technology enables accurate positioning and 3D model building. The imagery and point cloud data are both used for 3D model building, which can make up for the defect of single data sources.<br/>
                            <b>Application areas:</b>this platform can be used in various situations, for example, data capture for smart city building, smart transportation system, underground pipeline management system; landscape scanning and modeling before entering emergency sites, in order to enhance rapid decisions in disasters and reduce unnecessary casualties, and so on.<br/>
