                        <h2 >Urban remote sensing</h2>
                        <p>Remote sensing is the technique to detect information about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with the object. We have conducted extensive research in remote sensing, with emphases on change detection and object extraction.</p>
                        <h3>Change Detection</h3>
                        <p>Timely and accurate change detection of Earth’s surface features is extremely important for understanding relationships between human and natural phenomena in order to promote better decision making. Remote sensing data are primary sources extensively used for change detection in recent decades. Our group developed many change detection techniques including but not limited to: analyzing uncertainties of existing change detection methods, studying relationships between registration error and change detection accuracy, developing more reliable change detection methods combing spectral and spatial information, reducing the impacts of uncertainties in remote sensing data and change detection methods on the change detection results, and finally improving the accuracy of change detection. Our group developed the software ImageAnalytics which integrates all the methods we proposed.

                        <h3>Object extraction</h3>
                        <p>Object extraction is one of the most commonly used data acquisition methods in remote sensing and geographical sciences. Utilizing remote sensing data is an efficient and economical way for object extraction. Our group developed many methods for extracting ground objects including but not limited to roads and road centerlines, landslides, boulders and airport runways.

                            <b>Road extraction:</b>road information is vital for many aspects of daily life such as urban design, navigation, and image registration. Our group combines shape features and spectral-spatial information to extract road segments, and uses multivariate adaptive regression splines to extract road centerlines based on the extracted road segments.

                            <b>Landslide inventory mapping:</b>natural or human-induced landslide hazards often result in tremendous loss of human lives and properties. Traditional field survey for landslide mapping can obtain reliable results, but is often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly. In response to this problem, our group proposed a semi-automated approach for landslide inventory mapping from multi-phase high resolution aerial imagery.<br/>
                            <b>Boulder extraction:</b>boulder fall is one of the most frequent natural hazards in mountainous regions. It often causes fatal damages to the public infrastructures and residents’ properties, sometimes even threatens people’s lives. We proposed a method combining image analysis and LiDAR technology to automatically and accurately acquire the location and geometric information of boulders. Compared with traditional methods, our method achieves higher accuracy and provides more comprehensive information, and is less sensitive to illumination, location and noises in the meanwhile. We also developed the software StoneExtra which fully assembles our technique modules used in automatic boulder detection procedure.
